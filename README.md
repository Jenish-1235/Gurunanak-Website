## Setup and Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1\. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-website.git

   cd hospital-website

   ```

2\. **Install the database**:

   - Create a MySQL database (e.g., `hospital_db`).

   - Run the SQL script to create tables, specifically the `contacts` table for storing form submissions.

3\. **Update Database Configuration**:

   - In the `contact.php` file, update the database credentials:

     ```php

     $servername = "your_server";

     $username = "your_username";

     $password = "your_password";

     $dbname = "hospital_db";

     ```

4\. **Run the Website**:

   - Deploy the site on a PHP-supported server (like XAMPP, WAMP, or a web hosting platform).

   - Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost/hospital-website`.

## Usage

1\. **Navigating the Website**:

   - Browse through the navigation bar to visit sections like Home, Services, Doctors, Facilities, and Contact.

   - The website is fully responsive and should look good on any device.

2\. **Contact Form**:

   - Go to the **Contact Us** section to submit a message to the hospital.

   - Fill out your name, email, subject, and message, and click **Send Message**.

3\. **Appointment Booking**:

   - Navigate to the **Book Your Appointment** section, select a department, choose a date, and provide necessary details.

## Contact Form Integration

The contact form is built to handle inquiries and messages directly from the website. The submitted data is stored in a MySQL database for administrative review.

- **File**: `contact.php`

- **Table**: `contacts`

- **Database Structure**:

  ```sql

  CREATE TABLE contacts (

      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

      name VARCHAR(255),

      email VARCHAR(255),

      subject VARCHAR(255),

      message TEXT,

      submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

  );

  ```

- **Form Submission**:

  - Make sure your PHP server is configured and connected to the database.

  - After form submission, users receive a confirmation message.
